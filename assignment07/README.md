# Assignment 7: High-Fidelity Prototype | DH110 | Kaitlyn Li
## Overview—Ocean Preservation: From Microcosm to Macrocosm
### Project Description 
My project focuses on designing a website for people who are interested in sustainability and making a change towards ocean conservation. I hope that this project can encourage users to learn more about and advocate for the health of the ocean as well as realize that every small change that they make is valuable and can lead to large, collective change.
### Purpose of High-Fidelity Prototype
The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to redesign the original OceanCare website to be more efficient, accessible, and useful for users. I have included some new features that users through my previous projects have told me would be useful to include as well as modified existing features based on their feedback. This prototype allows for the visualization of different features in order to support users who want to make an impact regarding ocean preservation.
### Process of High-Fidelity Prototype
I used Figma, a design application, to create this high-fidelity prototype. Prior to this project, I had already conducted usability testing and contextual inquiry to decide on my tasks. Then I wireframed low-fidelity screens by hand on my iPad that were tested by users to gauge the intuitiveness of different interactions. Those low-fidelity screens were made for the desktop version, but I transformed all those screens to fit a mobile device and incorporated the user feedback to make the high-fidelity screens. After making all of the high-fidelity screens, I prototyped them so that they can be interactive and also more clearly displayed the interactions using the autoflow plugin on Figma.
## Tasks
Based on persona scenarios and contextual inquiries, the two tasks I have prototyped are:
- Task 1: Finding lifestyle changes related to plastic pollution and setting one of them (using plastic bag alternatives) as a personal goal.

- Task 2: Finding nearby community events revolving around ocean conservation and signing up for one.

## Wireflows

*Note that task 1 autoflow arrows are purple while task 2 autoflow arrows are pink.*

### Wireflow 1
> Disclaimer: Some of the interactions regarding overlay are missing from the picture below because of autoflow's limitations. For task 1, I only displayed the dropdown menu interaction with the main page screen due to it being an overlay and it looking very messy with autoflow if I did it to all screens. However, I did prototype the interaction with all the screens on Figma.

### Wireflow 2
> Disclaimer: Just like task 1, I only displayed the dropdown menu interaction with the main page screen for task 2 due to it being an overlay and it looking very messy with autoflow if I did it to all screens. However, I did prototype the interaction with all the screens on Figma. Additionally, I did display all the interactions via autoflow for task 2, but again, it is a little bit strange due to autoflow limitations.

### Findings
Overall, the cognitive walkthrough was extremely insightful. The process went by fairly smoothly—I found three testers and sent them the Google form, which also has Figma prototype embedded in it, and they took the survey along with testing the Figma prototype on their own respective devices. The main findings that were of most use to me were:
1. Even though mobile interfaces are all about scrolling, users do not always want to scroll to see what is on the bottom.
- It was difficult for some users to find buttons such as “Set a Goal” when they are on the bottom of a long, scrollable page. Having such information on top or an indication of what is below is useful for users. Information that is on top is much more discoverable.To redesign it, I would put the button underneath the “Lifestyle Changes” of each of the “Ongoing Issues” pages and with an accompanying sentence. Additionally, I would also make a change to the Home page, which has the “Learn More” and “Find Community Events” buttons at the very bottom. Because the buttons being on the bottom are not very discoverable, I would definitely move the buttons around. I would put the “Learn More” button below the statistics section and keep the “Find Community Events” button below the “Why Help” section because I think it coordinates better that way.
2. Users do not want to redo work that they already have spent time doing.
- When clicking on “Find More Events” after signing up for a community event, users are brought back to the initial page with the filters reset. However, since they have input the filters once already, they do not want to go through the trouble of doing it again. To fix this, upon clicking that button, I would return to the page with the filters they had initially input and the user could choose to edit the filters if they pleased. 
3. Logos should indicate a return to the home page.
- I did not initially prototype the logo to return to the home page because I left breadcrumbs at the top of pages with return states; however, users have revealed that it is something standard that they expect. I would prototype all of the logos to return to the home page for my next iteration.
