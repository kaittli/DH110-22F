# Ocean Preservation: Microcosm to Macrocosm

## Kaitlyn Li, Dh 110 UX + UI design, 2022 Fall

### Design statement
The purpose of this project is to create a website where people of all ages who are interested in sustainability can learn about different ocean sustainability topics and get involved through finding community events or learning simple lifestyle changes they can implement. To encourage users to continually engage with the site, they can also document their progress and participation in helping to mitigate ocean sustainability. Through time, they can hopefully realize that every small change that they make as individuals can result in a large collective change for the oceanâ€™s health.

### Research
I performed a heuristic evaluation of the website OceanCare to discover how usable the website is. Afterwards, I conducted user research to understand the ux issues with the website and what users want to see in a website regarding ocean sustainability.
