# Ocean Preservation: Microcosm to Macrocosm

## Kaitlyn Li, Dh 110 UX + UI design, 2022 Fall

## Introduction
My DH110 project is about improving the user experience of the existing website for OceanCare, an organization devoted towards promoting awareness about current issues plaguing the ocean’s health. While in college, I have personally become more knowledgeable about the state of the ocean and have been trying to practice sustainable habits, so I thought that other individuals may also be looking for a platform where they can empathize and try to alleviate the ocean crisis. I was inspired to redesign the OceanCare website specifically because I noticed numerous inefficiencies throughout the site that decreased the effectiveness of the message they are trying to convey. In this project, I implemented some changes to existing elements of the OceanCare site as well as added some novel features to hopefully make their message more compelling to users. I want users to realize that every small change that they make as individuals can result in a large collective change for the ocean’s health.
## Design Statement
Through my user testing and heuristic evaluation, I have concluded that the current OceanCare website lacks the freshness and intuitiveness ideal in a website that is meant to motivate individuals to take action to help save the ocean. There is no feature for people to feel encouraged or track their own impact, which is important so that people can feel impassioned to contribute. Additionally, there can be improvements on the process to finding nearby events for the OceanCare site in order to stimulate community involvement. Through implementing the aforementioned changes as well as developing a more seamless UI, I hope that people will be able to more easily learn about current marine issues and more willingly want to make a difference towards helping diminish those issues.

### Usability Testing
I performed a heuristic evaluation of the website OceanCare to discover how usable the website is. Afterwards, I conducted user research to understand the ux issues with the website and what users want to see in a website regarding ocean sustainability.
