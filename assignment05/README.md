# Assignment 5: Low-Fidelity Prototype | DH110 | Kaitlyn Li
## Title: Ocean Preservation—Microcosm to Macrocosm
## Description
For my project, I am choosing to redesign the OceanCare website and am focusing on important features of the site. The first feature that I will choose to focus on is the information architecture of the website in how the categories and subcategories of information are further organized so that users who want to gain any knowledge relating to ocean preservation can do so properly. 
### User Research
My user research focused on learning more about anybody who wants to be involved in ocean sustainability, but there was an emphasis on people who are currently already interested in being sustainable. I interviewed a third-year environmental science major student from UCLA. From the interview, I learned that common barriers to sustainable habits are thinking that it is very inconvenient as well as websites lacking easily distinguishable clues for different purposes. Learn more about user research here.
The questions I chose to focus on were:
1. How can information be presented more clearly in a way that is motivating rather than hindering for the user?
2. How can events for community involvement be found and signed up for more easily?
### Personas
I created two personas based on what I found from the user research—the first is interested in looking for consistent sustainable daily habits that can be easily incorporated while the other individual is looking for more hands-on contribution.
 
The first persona is a single mom of 2, named Victoria Lancaster, who has little leisurely time to devote towards extra causes. Her technical literacy is on the lower side as she does not interact much with devices, but she has been interested in wanting to make a change in becoming more sustainable.
The second persona is a college student, Charlie Dobbs, who has some experience in sustainability already and is on the more technically literate side. He is interested in finding community marine sustainability to attend together with others.

### Purpose of Low-Fidelity Prototyping
The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping is to ensure the functionality of the product is adequate by making sure that all my necessary features are included and establishing good user flow before developing the product even further. I want to ensure that the product I am designing has a good base in that the rough design with the components is one that is easy and intuitive for users. These wireframes can be tested with actual users and feedback can be taken into account to make edits before moving onto high-fidelity prototypes, which are much more detailed and drawn out. 
### Tasks
* Task 1: Finding easy lifestyle changes pertaining to a specific issue related to ocean sustainability
* Task 2: Finding and signing up for a community based event and adding it to an exportable calendar.
