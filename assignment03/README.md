# Assignment 3: User Research | DH110 | Kaitlyn Li
## Research & Requirements
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
This project would support users to be more proactive in fighting for marine preservation through encouraging the overall sustainability of the oceans by giving them comprehensive information about marine life so that they can learn more about current efforts and goals. 
### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity would fulfill multiple needs from Maslow’s Hierarchy. 
* Physiological needs: The state of the ocean is heavily linked to basic necessities—the health of the air, water, food, energy, etc that humans all need to survive/consume. Working towards improving the health of the ocean will improve the health of these resources. 
* Safety needs: Physical safety and emotional well-being/safety are important for individuals. The current condition of oceans is shaky, with issues such as ocean acidification and pollution becoming more rampant and threatening feelings of safety. 
* Esteem needs: Helping to alleviate a global issue like this one can provide more respect from other members in society as well as allow users to feel better about themselves. 
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions to the conservation of ocean resources include cutting back on plastic usage, carbon dioxide emissions, eating sustainable seafood, etc. Users also learn about up-to-date news/information on the state of the ocean and its resources through different websites or social media platforms in order to get involved. 
### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
The limitations of the online resources relating to ocean sustainability is that there can be greater accessibility to lead to an increase in ocean literacy as well as better online databases of information relating to community connections/efforts to help with ocean issues. 
## Target Users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
* Demographics: Anybody of any age who is interested in ocean sustainability because the impact of the ocean is not exclusive to anyone
* Preference: People who current practice sustainable habits and desire to do and learn more, individuals who also live in areas closer to ocean coasts
* Expertise: mainstream, no expertise required
### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
Users would most likely do this activity of learning more information about sustainability towards marine life in their homes and then can take what they have learned and apply it in their daily lives wherever they want. If they wish to get more information about clean up efforts or local events, they can attend those as well. 
### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
Users would type in ocean sustainability into online search platforms to find broad information or organizations working towards that goal. From there, users can learn about employing certain lifestyle changes that are more sustainable and learn more about how to contribute to conserving marine resources. The activity is complete once the user finds a community event that they can attend relating to the topic they researched about.
## Research Method
For this activity, I employed both participatory observation as well as an interview process.
I observed the user while she completed the tasks that I asked of her on her device. I also asked her to think aloud to get a better perspective. 
The interview consisted of the user answering questions on current background relating to the topic as well as interacting with the topic through tasks. After the user performed the tasks, I also asked follow up questions. 
## User Data
I decided to collect user data through an audio recording, which I also transcribed.

## Important Insights from Interview
:one: The user feels that there is a common misconception about ocean sustainability efforts.
*Why do you think other individuals may struggle with sustainability efforts towards helping the ocean?*
> I believe that it’s because a lot of people think that like trying to make their lives more sustainable would really inconvenience them, like a lot of people see being sustainable as like throwing away all of your clothes, living in like the woods somewhere or being completely vegan. And that’s not true, there’s a lot of like easier ways to make your life more sustainable, but like I suppose those ways are not as well advertised or extreme so they don’t have as much awareness, so that’s probably why a lot of individuals don’t take steps to make their lives more sustainable. 

:two: The user mentions content that would immediately draw them in and invoke the largest call to action.
> I feel like the first thing I would put in a website like that is like why it’s important to know sustainability and why to why like, like what benefits it gives us to preserve our oceans. And then the second part would be what you can do on an individual level to contribute to ocean sustainability, for example this website here, like beach cleanups or like spreading awareness and maybe a third one would be like larger group actions such as like maybe like you.

:three: The user places a lot of emphasis on the title that pops up after inputting search into engine, can dictate whether user clicks on site or not.
> Most of these websites are talking about like larger solutions like those enacted by the government, but I found one website that says “Six practical things that you can do” so I assume it is on an individual level.
 
:four: The user likes tags, or additional information presented in a concise manner.
*So what do you think about all of these different events as far as like getting the average individual involved in these like, yeah?*
> So these are actually really nicely labeled by time commitment, so it’s nice for individuals who don’t want to have a heavy time commitment, like they have two events labeled light time commitment to labeled medium so depending on your time commitment, your schedule, and like how much you’re willing to put in these, they’re definitely events for like every level of commitment or like that any individual is willing to take up and they have a wide range of activities too, it’s not just beach cleanups. 

## Reflection
There are a few things that I would change if I were to conduct this session again. I do think that some of my questions may have ended up being leading questions as I offered suggestions afterwards. For example, I asked “So when you’re making these active efforts in your lifestyle, what do you value most when it comes to those—for example like degree of effort, level of impact etc.?”. I should have not added the extra detail at the end and have left the question open-ended because questions like this may lead to bias. 

I actually believed I learned a lot from this user interview session because I really got to dive into what a user actually thinks about a product in relation to the topic. Asking all of the questions that I formed to an actual potential user uncovered many motivations, influences, features to consider to include into a product. Learning about other users and their backgrounds allows me to empathize with the actual consumers of my end product, providing me with more insight and is really a crucial component when it comes to designing. My participant for this activity was not the same individual that participated in the usability testing. This participant had more knowledge of marine preservation and of sustainability practices in general, which is a different perspective. Something that I have to remember from this experience is that there are users that may not be interested in ocean preservation at all, so there may be different techniques that I’ll have to research to draw them in. I think that getting feedback and opinions from another person, especially someone who is very much passionate about this topic, will allow me to better ideate an end product that will be more effective and rewarding.
