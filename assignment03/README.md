# Assignment 3: User Research | DH110 | Kaitlyn Li
## Description of Project
### Research & Requirements
#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
This project would support users to be more proactive in fighting for marine preservation through encouraging the overall sustainability of the oceans by giving them comprehensive information about marine life so that they can learn more about current efforts and goals. 
#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? (reference)
This activity would fulfill multiple needs from Maslow’s Hierarchy. 
* Physiological needs: The state of the ocean is heavily linked to basic necessities—the health of the air, water, food, energy, etc that humans all need to survive/consume. Working towards improving the health of the ocean will improve the health of these resources. 
* Safety needs: Physical safety and emotional well-being/safety are important for individuals. The current condition of oceans is shaky, with issues such as ocean acidification and pollution becoming more rampant and threatening feelings of safety. 
* Esteem needs: Helping to alleviate a global issue like this one can provide more respect from other members in society as well as allow users to feel better about themselves. 
#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current solutions to the conservation of ocean resources include cutting back on plastic usage, carbon dioxide emissions, eating sustainable seafood, etc. Users also learn about up-to-date news/information on the state of the ocean and its resources through different websites or social media platforms in order to get involved. 
#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
The limitations of the online resources relating to ocean sustainability is that there can be greater accessibility to lead to an increase in ocean literacy as well as better online databases of information relating to community connections/efforts to help with ocean issues. 
### Target Users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
* Demographics: Anybody of any age who is interested in ocean sustainability because the impact of the ocean is not exclusive to anyone
* Preference: People who current practice sustainable habits and desire to do and learn more, individuals who also live in areas closer to ocean coasts
* Expertise: mainstream, no expertise required
#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
Users would most likely do this activity of learning more information about sustainability towards marine life in their homes and then can take what they have learned and apply it in their daily lives wherever they want. If they wish to get more information about clean up efforts or local events, they can attend those as well. 
#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
Users would type in ocean sustainability into online search platforms to find broad information or organizations working towards that goal. From there, users can learn about employing certain lifestyle changes that are more sustainable and learn more about how to contribute to conserving marine resources. The activity is complete once the user finds a community event that they can attend relating to the topic they researched about.
### Research Method
For this activity, I employed both participatory observation as well as an interview process.
I observed the user while she completed the tasks that I asked of her on her device. I also asked her to think aloud to get a better perspective. 
The interview consisted of the user answering questions on current background relating to the topic as well as interacting with the topic through tasks. After the user performed the tasks, I also asked follow up questions.
